<analysis>
The previous AI engineer focused on transforming the MVP into an enterprise-level application across several distinct phases. Initial tasks included implementing period-based filtering in  (frontend) and modifying the corresponding backend endpoint (). A significant effort was dedicated to making the  table dynamic, requiring critical backend updates to expose  and  data.

A major UX overhaul followed, introducing dynamic KPI cards (), interactive charting via Recharts on the new Veri Analizi page, full mobile responsiveness, and a Dark Mode feature. AI Analytics capabilities were added via the  endpoint. A critical bug was resolved concerning incorrect internal routing in the  component. The current, immediate task is to enable the end-to-end workflow by integrating real Gmail SMTP using the App Password provided by the user.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a Digital Management System (DMS) for tracking performance and operational data. Core features implemented include robust Authentication, CRUD operations for Employees, and dynamic Question Management. Questions now support various  types (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, etc.) and user-defined dynamic columns ().

Key implemented features:
1.  **Period-based Filtering:** Ability to filter shared questions by their defined period type on the Soruları Paylaş page.
2.  **Dynamic Response Table:** Refactoring the response page to dynamically generate columns based on the question's period (e.g., Year/Month, Year/Quarter) and locking past/future periods.
3.  **Data Analysis/Reporting:** Creation of a Veri Analizi (Data Analysis) dashboard featuring interactive graphs (Recharts), historical data tables, and AI-generated insights (trend, anomaly detection).
4.  **UX Modernization:** Implementation of a sticky header, dynamic KPI cards (fetching real-time stats via ), mobile responsiveness (Phase 3), and persistent Dark Mode (Phase 4).
5.  **Routing Fix:** Correcting navigation errors in the Program Sabitleri section to correctly route to Employee and Question management pages.
6.  **Automation Readiness:** Setup for email automation and reporting scheduling.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend:** React, Shadcn/UI, Tailwind CSS, Recharts for advanced data visualization, .
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Pydantic data modeling (for dynamic ), MongoDB (using UUIDs), JWT authentication.
- **AI/Integrations:**  for analytics, Gmail SMTP integration for live email sending via App Password.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, communicating via REST APIs (all backend routes prefixed with ). MongoDB is used for data persistence.



- :
    - **Summary:** Holds core logic, models, and endpoints.
    - **Changes:** Modified key endpoints:  (added  filtering),  (updated to return dynamic  and  data). New endpoints added:  (for KPI),  (for AI analytics), and  (for scheduling).

- :
    - **Summary:** Manages frontend dependencies.
    - **Changes:** Added  for charting functionality.

- :
    - **Summary:** Central file for routing, state, and component definitions (including AuthContext).
    - **Changes:** Major redesign and feature additions:
        - Implemented  and  hook for Dark Mode.
        - Redesigned  component with dynamic KPI cards, Activity Feed, and modern header.
        - Created  (temporary) and  (permanent feature) components.
        - Updated  for client-side period filtering logic.
        - Critical Bug Fix: Updated  routing to correctly distinguish between 'category', 'department', 'employee', and 'question' management views.

<pending_tasks>
- Finalize Gmail SMTP integration by updating backend environment variables ().
- Complete FAZE 6: Implement the frontend configuration for Email Automation/Reporting.
- Complete FAZE 7: Implement Global Search and PDF/Excel export functionalities.
- Implement the missing notification bell icon functionality in the dashboard header.

<current_work>
The immediate work preceding this summary was the resolution of a critical routing issue in the Program Sabitleri section, ensuring navigation links correctly opened Personel Yönetimi and Soru Ekle Yönetimi instead of Departman Yönetimi.

The current focus is initiating the end-to-end testing workflow by setting up real email sending. The AI engineer successfully obtained the necessary playbook for Gmail SMTP integration using the  tool. The user subsequently provided the required credentials: email address  and App Password . The application is currently poised to have its backend  file updated with these SMTP credentials to enable live email functionality via  configuration, allowing for the first real-world test of the Soruları Paylaş feature.
