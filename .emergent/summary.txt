The AI engineer's work primarily focused on iteratively building and refining a digital management system. Key features implemented include a robust authentication system, comprehensive employee and question management modules, and a Share Questions feature with email integration. Significant efforts were dedicated to developing a Responses system, which evolved from simple monthly entries to a complex, dynamic 5+ year table supporting multi-data fields and AI-generated comments. A recurring challenge involved frontend authentication persistence during navigation, which was debugged and rectified multiple times. The codebase underwent a major refactor to streamline the question and response models, transitioning to a clean, table-based approach. The latest task involves implementing period-based filtering and dynamic table restructuring for question responses.

<product_requirements>
The user initially requested a digital management system with authentication (login/registration). Core features included:
1.  **Employee Management (Kişi Ekle):** CRUD for employee details (name, department, salary, etc.).
2.  **Dashboard Customization:** UI/UX refinements, navigation consolidation.
3.  **Question Bank (Soru Ekle):** Standardized questions with categories, importance, expected action, and graphic type. Initially,  (numerical/textual/both) was added, then evolved to dynamic  (e.g., Sales, Marketing, HR) for complex data entry.  (Monthly, Weekly, Daily, Quarterly) was also added.
4.  **Program Constants (Program Sabitleri):** Dynamic management of question categories and departments.
5.  **Share Questions (Soruları Paylaş):** Assign questions to employees via email links. This now includes the ability to re-send questions multiple times and is pending period-based filtering.
6.  **Email Log:** View sent demo emails.
7.  **Response Status (Cevap Durumu):** Track question response statuses.
8.  **Responses (Cevaplar):** (Currently being developed) A system to display questions with multi-data values, employee comments, AI comments (using OpenAI GPT-5), monthly/period-based tables, and graphics. The latest iteration requires a 5+ year table where users input data for the active period, with past data read-only and future data disabled. The table structure must dynamically adapt, showing Year/Month (or Week/Day) as distinct columns, followed by user-defined  as columns, and a comment column.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture: React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.



**Key Files and Changes:**

-   
    -   **Summary:** Main FastAPI application with all API endpoints, MongoDB connection, Pydantic models, JWT authentication, and email.
    -   **Changes:**
        -   Refactored  model to include  and  (replacing  and ).
        -   Introduced  and  models for the new dynamic table structure.
        -   Updated  model to accommodate dynamic  (dictionary of ).
        -   Modified AI comment generation to process dynamic  and .
        -   Removed old  endpoints and implemented new  endpoints for bulk and single submissions, supporting the new table-based responses.
        -   Modified  endpoint to allow re-sending questions without creating duplicate assignments.
        -   Integrated  library for AI calls using .
-   
    -   **Summary:** Stores backend environment variables.
    -   **Changes:** Confirmed  is present and utilized.
-   
    -   **Summary:** Main React component handling routing, authentication, and displaying various features.
    -   **Changes:**
        -   **Authentication:** Multiple fixes applied to , , and  logic to ensure token and user state persistence across navigation, addressing recurring redirection issues.  logic was refined.
        -   **Question Management:** Updated  component's form to replace  and  with  and  input. Updated question table display to reflect .
        -   **Responses ():**  (for logged-in users) and  (for email links) were completely refactored. The  now renders a dynamic table (2025 Sep - 2030 Dec) with ,  (or / based on ),  as columns, and a comment column. Conditional rendering for active/read-only/disabled cells based on current period.
        -   **Share Questions ():** The component was updated to display backend messages for question re-send.
-   
    -   **Summary:** Manages Node.js dependencies.
    -   **Changes:** Added  for charting.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Period-based Filtering on Soruları Paylaş page:** Implement filter buttons (Günlük, Haftalık, Aylık, Çeyreklik, Altı Aylık, Yıllık, İhtiyaç Halinde) to dynamically filter the questions displayed based on their  property.
-   **Dynamic Response Table Restructuring:** Adjust the response table (PublicQuestionResponse and ResponsesComponent) to display appropriate period columns (e.g.,  for weekly,  for daily) based on the question's  value.
-   **Active Period Logic:** Implement logic to ensure only the relevant period's inputs are active in the response table (e.g., only the current day for daily questions, current week for weekly, current month for monthly).
-   **Production SMTP Configuration:** The email sending is still demo-only.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with implementing period-based filtering on the Soruları Paylaş page and dynamically restructuring the response tables. The user explicitly requested filter buttons for Günlük, Haftalık, Aylık, Çeyreklik, Altı Aylık, Yıllık, and İhtiyaç Halinde periods. Clicking these buttons should filter the displayed questions accordingly. Furthermore, the response tables (for filling out answers) need to adapt their column structure based on the question's period (e.g.,  for monthly,  for weekly,  for daily), and only the current period's input fields should be active for data entry, with past data read-only and future data disabled. The previous message (Chat Message 750) confirms the understanding of this request, and the AI engineer is about to start implementing Adım 1: Soruları Paylaş sayfasına period filtreleri ekleme (Chat Message 752). This means the work is at the very beginning of the frontend implementation for this feature, specifically in the  component.
